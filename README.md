### üóÇ 1. Data Import & Exploration

#### A. Import CSV into SQL (MySQL / PostgreSQL / SQLite / etc.)

You can import the dataset using your preferred SQL tool (e.g., MySQL Workbench, pgAdmin, SQLiteStudio).

If using MySQL Workbench:

##### A1. Create a database:

##### A2.Create a table:

CREATE TABLE Transactions (
    InvoiceNo VARCHAR(20),
    StockCode VARCHAR(20),
    Description TEXT,
    Quantity INT,
    InvoiceDate DATETIME,
    UnitPrice FLOAT,
    CustomerID VARCHAR(20),
    Country VARCHAR(50)
);


##### A3. Import the CSV using Table Data Import Wizard in MySQL Workbench.

#### B. Initial Data Exploration Queries

* View First 10 rows

* Check Null Values

* Count Duplicate Rows

* Create a Cleaned Version of the Table

If you don‚Äôt want to delete rows from the original, create a cleaned copy:

* OPTIONAL: Check row count before and after

<img width="1487" height="405" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8e452ed2-7c96-4f79-a565-57a2de2db83c" />


Check for NULLs in Important Columns

-- OPTIONAL: Filter out rows with negative Quantity/UnitPrice and null CustomerID

-- Create a filtered view or temporary table

<img width="1917" height="1016" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b500ae2e-d924-4056-b443-5e77b63d1666" />



üßº Data Cleaning Process

1. **Removed duplicate rows** using `SELECT DISTINCT`.
2. **Filtered invalid rows**: Quantity ‚â§ 0, UnitPrice ‚â§ 0, and null CustomerIDs were excluded.
3. Created a `Valid_Transactions` view for clean analysis.
4. Verified date format and converted `InvoiceDate` to `DATETIME` where required.



## üßÆ SQL Queries Used

> All queries were executed on the `Transactions_Cleaned` table and `Valid_Transactions` view.

* TOTAL REVENUE

* TOP 5 PRODUCTS BY REVENUE

## üìà Key Insights

A few products dominate the revenue generation.

Some customers contribute disproportionately to total sales.


## üß† Reflection

This project offered practical exposure to real-world data audit challenges in SQL:

Managing dirty and duplicate data

Writing optimized, business-friendly queries

Gaining analytical insights using only SQL

Seasonal spikes in revenue indicate stronger sales during year-end months.


## ‚úÖ Tech Stack

Database: MySQL

Tools: MySQL Workbench, Excel (optional for validation)

Language: SQL



## üßæ Conclusion


Through this SQL-based audit and analysis of the Online Retail dataset, I was able to simulate a real-world business intelligence project using only raw transactional data and structured queries. Key takeaways include:

Data Quality is Critical: The initial dataset contained duplicates, missing values, and invalid entries. Cleaning the data was essential for accurate analysis.

SQL is Powerful for Business Insight: Using basic to advanced SQL queries, I was able to identify high-revenue products, valuable customers, and sales patterns over time‚Äîinsights that would directly support marketing, inventory, and customer retention strategies.

Trends Matter: The monthly sales analysis revealed seasonal fluctuations, highlighting opportunities for time-based promotions or campaigns.

Customer Focus is Key: A small subset of customers drove a large share of the revenue, which implies the importance of loyalty programs and targeted outreach.

This project not only enhanced my skills in SQL and data auditing but also reinforced the importance of structured thinking and clean data in deriving actionable business insights.
